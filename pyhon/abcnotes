Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:

1:--Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
2:--External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. 
Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.

##Variables and Objects
•Variables are the basic unit of storage for a program.
• Variables can be created and destroyed.
• At a hardware level, a variable is a reference to a location in memory.
• Programs perform operations on variables and alter or fill in their values.
• Objects are higher level constructs that include one or more variables and the set of operations that work on these variables.
• An object can therefore be considered a more complex variable.
•Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data.

##Classes vs. Objects
•A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. 
 In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. 
 This object will then be called the instance of the class.
• Every Object belongs to a certain class.
• Classes are abstract descriptions of the structure and functions of an object.
• Objects are created when an instance of the class is created by the program.
• For example, “Fruit” is a class while an “Apple” is an object.

##Datatypes
•there are different types of datatypes in python.

1:--List
•list is use to store multiple items in a single variable.
•it is ordered and mutable and it allows duplicate items.
•it uses sq. bracket[].
• syntax -- day1 = ['monday' , 'tuesday' , 'wednessday']
>>> it's operations are
    •apend , insert , remove , sort , extend , pop , delete, reverse.

2:--Tuple 
• It is collection of items which is orderd and unchangeable.
• writen in () round bracket.
• Maintain integrity of data during program execution.
>>> operations are
   •access items , count items , lenght method , looping , index method.

Dictionaries:
• Dictionaries are unordered and changeable mappings of ’Name : Value’ associations. 
• Comparable to hashes and associative arrays in other languages. 
• Intended to approximate how humans remember associations.
• it uses {} curly bracket.

Sets
 • Special data type introduced since Python 2.4 onwards to support mathematical set theory operations.
 • Unordered collection of unique items.
 • Set itself is mutable, BUT every item in the set has to be an immutable type.
 • So, sets can have numbers, strings and tuples as items but cannot have lists or dictionaries as items.

Indentation:
 •Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code. It's crucial for readability and structure.

Break:
  the break statement enables a program to skip over a part of the program.
  A break statement terminates the very loop it lies within.

NumPy:
   Purpose: NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for numerical computing in
   Python.

Key Features:
  o Multidimensional arrays: Efficient data structures for representing vectors, matrices, and
  tensors.
  o Mathematical functions: A wide range of mathematical operations that can be applied
  element-wise to arrays.
  o Broadcasting: A powerful mechanism for performing operations on arrays of different
  shapes.
